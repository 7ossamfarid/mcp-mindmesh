# 🌌 MCP MindMesh: Orchestrating Intelligent Swarms 🌌

![MCP MindMesh](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0.0-blue.svg) ![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Releases-latest-yellow.svg)

## 🚀 Overview

**MCP MindMesh** is a powerful server designed to manage multiple Claude 3.7 Sonnet instances in a quantum-inspired swarm. This Model Context Protocol (MCP) server facilitates a field coherence effect across various specialized agents in pattern recognition, information theory, and reasoning. By leveraging ensemble intelligence, it produces responses that are not just accurate but optimally coherent.

## 🎯 Features

- **Swarm Intelligence**: Coordinate multiple Claude 3.7 Sonnet agents to work together effectively.
- **Field Coherence**: Achieve enhanced coherence in responses through shared insights.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Utilize various specialized agents to tackle complex tasks.
- **Quantum Inspiration**: Draws from quantum principles to enhance processing capabilities.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14.x or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/7ossamfarid/mcp-mindmesh.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd mcp-mindmesh
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Server

To start the MCP MindMesh server, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 🌐 Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with it through its API. Here's a simple example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/execute -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"input": "Your query here"}'
```

The server will respond with optimized outputs based on the collaborative processing of its agents.
